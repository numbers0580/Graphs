#UPER

#To solve this path, you'll want to construct your own traversal graph. 
# You start in room 0, which contains exits ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']. 
#  
# need to create own traversal path- set of directions for player to raver
            # start by initializing empty traversal path
# create a visited set/dictionary to keep track of the visited rooms
            #initialize empty visited set() or {}   
# 
# 
# 
# You know you are done when you have exactly 500 entries (0-499) in your graph  
#and no '?' in the adjacency dictionaries. To do this, 
# you will need to write a traversal algorithm 
# that logs the path into traversal_path as it walks.
# (i.e) meaning seaparate paths/lists needs to made to keep track of the changes
# 
# think of using either bfs (queue)

#  or dfs(stack)
# Start by writing an algorithm that picks a random unexplored direction 
# from the player's current room, travels and logs that direction, then loops. 
# This should cause your player to walk a depth-first traversal. 
# When you reach a dead-end (i.e. a room with no unexplored paths),
#  walk back to the nearest room that does contain an unexplored path.
